TODO:

-- Improve segmenter:

  * Ensure ellipses start/end in reasonable places
  * Associate original ink points with ant segments
  * Associate ant segments with patch points
  * Use timestamps to determine where points are. Much better than interpolating position.
  * For ellipse/ellipse junctions, probably replace them with spline segments.

-- Beyond segmentation:

  * Latcher:
    > Latch types: 
      \ Tee: One segment ends at the surface of another
      \ Co-terminate: Two segments end at same location with different angles
      \ Continuation: Two segments share angles, and they co-terminate, with a looser rule
    > Will move/rotate/scale latched segments in some way... how? I suppose I use original segment
      locations?
    > Keep this separate from constraint rectification (e.g. perpendicular)
  * Constraints beyond latching
    > Parallel
    > Perpendicular
    > Same length
    > Same angle
    > Passes through point
    > more...

      
? Can I just represent a smooth arc region as a distribution of angles? I need to be able to search
  for curved segments by comparing their curvature, e.g. find curved pieces about X long that curve
  in the following way: [..] This way I can calculate how different two given curves are. I can do
  this if it is a spline or if it is an ellipse-arc. What does an ellipse do for me beyond giving
  me a non-spline segment type? I can't just juse splines for everything because they would fit
  almost-but-not-quite-straight segments perfectly, so *everything* would end up being a spline,
  which is not what I want at all.
