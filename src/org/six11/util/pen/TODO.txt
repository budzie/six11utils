Things to do for the pen tools:

- Need a Functions method for returning a normalized sequence of n
  pieces. Look at my notes on page 176 of the notebook. I do not
  believe there is a symbolic way of solving this problem, but there
  might be an iterative numerical approach:
  
    segLength = sequence.length() / nPieces;
    play = +infinity;
    safety = 0;
    do {
        modified = Functions.chop(sequence, segLength); // does not tack on endpoint
	play = amount the modified sequence undershoots actual sequence;
        segLength += play / nPieces; // play should be negative if it overshoots
	safety++;
    } while (play > threshold && safety < 10);
    
- Add select functions:
  - strength = 1 - (partial/whole)^2
  - strength = (-cos(Ï€x) + 1) / 2
